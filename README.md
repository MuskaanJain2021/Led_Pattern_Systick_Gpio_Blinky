### Project Title: Traffic Light Simulation using STM32F407






# Led_Pattern_Systick_Gpio_Blinky
 This project demonstrates a traffic light simulation using the STM32F407 microcontroller and its onboard LEDs. The simulation controls the green, red, and orange LEDs to emulate different traffic light states and patterns, providing a practical exercise in GPIO configuration, SysTick timer usage, and interrupt handling in embedded systems. The project includes individual LED blinking, combinations of LEDs, multi-LED patterns, and sequential LED patterns, all with precise timing managed by the SysTick timer. This project aims to enhance understanding of embedded programming fundamentals and real-time system operations.
